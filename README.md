# **_e-Move Co._**

## Introduction
The E-Move Co. courier service is a simple, straightforward, intuitive and unique courier booking website that caters to any consumer's courier needs in a whole new different way. In these progressive and modern times, there is a huge number of businesses that offer logistics and courier services worldwide available to consumers. But what makes E-Move Co movers different from the rest? This courier service not only offers the ease and convenience of sending or receiving goods/parcels on the very same-day or even as soon as in a few hours, delivered straight to the customer's door but also, provides the benefit of sending even delicate items, food and even cakes a baker made and a whole lot more. New customers can register/sign-up to create an account, which enables them to make a booking and save into their account for record keeping purposes and modification whenever necessary. Existing customers simply just need to login and get on with the booking or access their account or bookings.

This website was developed as part of the requirements of my course Full Stack Software Development. This is the fourth project and is built using Django+Python with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This website provides data management (using relational databases such as ElephantSQL, Postgres) wherein users can create booking and save it, retrieve it, modify and delete whenever necessary.

# User Experience UX

## The Strategy plane

### Site Goals

*  The e-Move Co. website is intended to cater every customer's courier needs. Unlike most of the courier services, e-Move Co aims to provide delivery services within the same day, or just within a few hours upon booking. The e-Move Co also offers superior flexibility of sending almost everything. On top of the normal items usually being sent, such as documents and goods such as clothings, gadgets, office and household stuff in packets or boxes, customers can also send food (hot, cold or frozen), plants, cooked food and even baked goods one just made. Bulky and odd items are on our list too. Sending anything to someone the soonest possible time of the day has never been this easy with e-Move Co.

### Epics

The following epics were created to organise the user stories I was able to come up with. Since the website is pretty basic and simple, where booking a courier service is the main and only objective, only a couple of tasks needs to be done, hence, there's not much Epics and User stories thought of. Epics are created using Milestones in Github.

* EPIC 1: Environment Setup  #1
* EPIC 2: User Management #2
* EPIC 3: Booking #3]
* EPIC 4: User Interface/Styling #4]
